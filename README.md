# StyleScan

## About

One page scrollable website created to showcase the features of the app
StyleScan, an app that can scan real world products, traditional advertisements
and logos, and not only find the product but produce similar alternatives.

This was a tech test that was mainly design orientated, and therefore most of
the work went into the HTML and CSS.

The design was of the website was created by me, [Nathaniel
Green](http://github.com/nathanielgreen), with some inspiriation provided by the
tech test provider, in the form of a video consisting of similar animations on a
phone.

All images and logos used a **not** my property, and are merely used as example
images to act as placeholder for potential images in the app, and would not be
used in production.



## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery

The site is not yet mobile ready, and has only been tested on more recent
versions of Chrome and Firefox. Proper support is not planned for this project,
as this was only a tech test.

All code was written by [Nathaniel Green](http://github.com/nathanielgreen),
with no frameworks or bootstrap being used in the design or creation of the
website, aside from MarvelApp Devices for the transparent images of the phones,
provided in the [devices.min.css](./stylesheets/devices.min.css) file.
